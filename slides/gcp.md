### Cloud VPN (IPSec)

Cloud VPN securely connects your peer network to your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network through an IPsec VPN connection

Traffic traveling between the two networks is encrypted by one VPN gateway and then decrypted by the other VPN gateway

This action protects your data as it travels over the internet

### Cloud Routers (BGP)

### Interconnect

Cloud Interconnect provides low latency, high availability connections that enable you to reliably transfer data between your on-premises and Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks

Also, Interconnect connections provide internal IP address communication, which means internal IP addresses are directly accessible from both networks
